👋 Hi, I’m @abbybade

👀 As a passionate data enthusiast, I am deeply interested in the intersection of data algorithms, machine learning, AI, and their application in business analysis. My curiosity lies in leveraging predictive modeling and data analysis tools to solve complex business challenges, improve decision-making processes, and drive strategic initiatives.

🌱 Currently, I’m on a journey to master the art of data science, advancing  my skills in predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I'm dedicated to learning advanced techniques in machine learning, with a keen focus on their applicability in forecasting, risk management, and customer insights. My toolkit is expanding with practical experience in Python, R, SQL and business intelligence platforms like Tableau and Power BI.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that align with my passion for turning data into business value. Whether it’s through predictive analytics in finance, optimizing supply chains, enhancing customer experiences, or identifying new market opportunities, I am eager to contribute my analytical skills and learn from real-world applications.
